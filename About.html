    <h1>The need for yet another meta config language tool</h1>
    <br>
    I've used a ton of config languages in various tool and projects,
    and have universally been dissatisfied by the results.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I've tried TOML, which is mostly great, but resulted in ambiguities
    with the [[ ]] notation and was hard to support.<br>
    <br>
    I've used YAML, but pretty much hated the strictness on spacing<br>
    <br>
    I've tried JSON, but was quite disappointed with the lack of
    comments, and the rigidity around comma placement.<br>
    <br>
    I looked at SANE, but didn't like the adamant belief that block
    quotes shouldn't be allowed (they're super useful for commenting out
    a section of code/config and trying something else in a pinch)<br>
    <br>
    I looked ad SDLANG, but didn't like their forcing of numbers to
    32/64 bit values.<br>
    <br>
    I looked at dhall.&nbsp; Lots of good stuff there.&nbsp; No
    implementation in C or C++ yet, though, and I'm not sure I'm going
    to be the one to cover all that it can do...<br>
    <br>
    So, those are the starting points for coming up with something of my
    own.&nbsp; But... how do I come up with something of my own?<br>
    <br>
    <h1>Goals for a config parser tool</h1>
    I would like a tool that allows me to specify in a 'simple' way the
    format for input, and then I'd like that tool to help me as a
    programmer validate user input, and help the user to create valid
    input.<br>
    <br>
    I'd like the same meta-description that is used to parse the input
    to be used to help the user.&nbsp; I'd like man-page style help
    descriptions available for correcting config files and command line
    arguments.&nbsp; I'd like the ability to add or create new grammars
    at run time so that things like modules can specify their own syntax
    and be added to the configuration system dynamically.<br>
    <br>
    Support UTF-8 and alternative character sets.<br>
    <br>
    Re-usability<br>
    - Same description<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parses the config file<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; validates the config file<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates documentation for the format of the
    config file<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides user help for fixing/editing/creating
    the config file<br>
    <br>
    - Same description language (and maybe even description)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parses argv command line input<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides documentation for the format of the argv
    input<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates documentation for the format of the
    input file<br>
    <br>
    - Same description language (and maybe even description)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parses cli input<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides input completions<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides realtime help by knowing the required
    input format<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates documentation for the cli<br>
    <br>
    Reformat an input in a "canonical" order and format<br>
    Load a config file from one format and output to another format
    (translate)<br>
    <br>
    I'd also like the back end to be agnostic from the front end.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, you should be able to load a 'TOML' description and
    configure your program with a TOML config file, or load a JSON
    config file and configure that same program with a JSON config
    file.&nbsp; If you want your special version of JSON in your config
    file to ... say ... SUPPORT COMMENTS -- like EVEN BLOCK COMMENTS ...
    you should be able to adjust the JSON input file and do that.<br>
    <h1>Why not an existing parser tool</h1>
    <br>
    Well, great question.&nbsp; 'cuz my first generation is surely not
    going to be as great as what's been created over the years, since I
    don't yet know how to deal with AST and other trees and different LR
    parsing orders and whatnot.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a> and yacc<br>
    lex and flex<br>
    <a href="http://lrstar.org/">LRStar</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    My goals are<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Make it easy on the USER.&nbsp; Be gracious
    and try to understand what they want.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Enable scientific configuration.&nbsp; Focus
    on math, units, and ease of specifying things CORRECTLY<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Figure out how to HELP the user.&nbsp; Make
    validation and errors CLEAR and helpful.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Make it clean and easy to read (as much as can
    be figured out, anyway)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Make it easy to comment out blocks to try new
    things
